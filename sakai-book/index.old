<h1><a href="https://www.createspace.com/3609835">Reviewer Comments</a></h1>
<p>
"An insightful look into a real open source project."  - Mark Norton
</p><br/><p>
"The author's personal style puts you right at the centre of the maelstrom.
The book also gracefully highlights how well the individuals involved 
worked together despite the daily wear."
- <a href="http://fsmsh.com/3564" target="_new">Alan Berg (Free Software Magazine)</a>
<p><br/></p>
"Sakai was a pioneer in teaching higher education that we could 
collaborate at scale. Countless lives were changed through that 
journey, and Chuck gives an insider's look at the people and myriad 
decisions that shaped the community." - Brad Wheeler
</p><br/><p>
"Charles Severance is Sakai."  - Joel Greenberg
</p><br/><p>
"Chuck's conversational style in the telling
of the story of the historically significant 
Sakai open-source project and its worldwide impact in 
higher education makes it an enjoyable read!" - Carol Dippel
</p><br/><p>
"As somewhat of an insider myself, I was still intrigued by 
the inside inside look and thrououghly enjoyed discovering 
what I never knew was happening behind the scenes. It was 
great fun reliving the Sakai experience - it brought to 
mind many forgotten friends and experiences." - John Leasia
</p><br/><p>
"Building software is easy, building a community is a 
whole different animal." - Rob Lowden
</p><br/><p>
"Can the global educational community provide leadership 
in educational technology? The story of Sakai shows that 
the answer is 'yes'. This book chronicles many of the 
individuals involved - all of whom deserve 
a special thanks." - Rob Abel, Ed.D.
</p><br/><p>
"Sakai and its leadership demonstrated that a mainstream, 
multi-faceted application for non-technical users could 
be designed, developed, maintained, and improved under 
the open source business model.  The product and the 
community it fostered, secured a place for open source as 
an operative path to bring significant productivity 
tools to market." - Jeff Kahn
</p><br/><p>
"This book is a real learning-by-doing experience. 
A love history between Chuck and the 
Sakai Community." - Francesc Santanach
</p><br/><p>
"Dr. Chuck is rare beast, able to go from 
the hills of enlightenment, vision and strategy and then 
down to the seventh level of Dante's Hell with concrete 
technical detail and hang with the geeks." - Marc Alier
</p><br/><p>
"Warning: Exposure to such high levels of boldness, insight and
refreshing sanity may result in a extreme desire to engage in
community source projects." - David Barroso
